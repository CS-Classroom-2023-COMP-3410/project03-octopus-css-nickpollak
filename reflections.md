This was difficult. At first I asked for a whole set up to start editing every aspect of the website, using all the tags and classes. In retrospect I would've asked to start modifying the header and describing in detail exactly what I needed it to look like. However, I got the basic outline and kept pestering chat gpt to change small aspects or show me the specific style detail I would need to change in order to modify small things. Then I would go in on my own and make it work how I liked or thought looked correct. I knew that using a little chat gpt and a little of my own work wouldn't be as efficient, but I felt like I got an understanding for some of the commands better. It still looks slightly different, and not quite as polished as I'd liked, but I did a good amount of work on my own for this, and tried to figure some of my own problems out. Chat gpt is very helpful and definitely can help find the specifics I needed for the project at the time even from my rudimentary descriptions. Overall I enjoyed this more than trying to make my own website from scratch.
