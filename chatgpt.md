N: can you make a style sheet in css that has ids: header, main, quiz-section, species-table, and footer
Chat: Here is a simple CSS stylesheet that styles the provided IDs: `header`, `main`, `quiz-section`, `species-table`, and `footer`.
N:how to make a blue gradient from dark blue to light blue with centered white text for the header
Chat:The header now has a blue gradient background transitioning from dark blue to light blue, with centered white text. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
N:how would I make the corners of the background rounded 
Chat:I added rounded corners to the header background by applying a `border-radius` of 12px. Let me know if you’d like a different radius or further adjustments!
N:how to make all h class text aqua blue
Chat:All elements with the class `h` now have their text color set to aqua blue. Let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to modify!
N:how to make the dots in a ul a different color than the text
Chat:The `ul` dots are now styled separately from the text by using the `::before` pseudo-element, allowing you to customize their color independently. Let me know if you need further tweaks!
N:how to change the color without making a new dot in front of the list 
Chat:The dot color in the unordered list (`ul`) has been updated to red by applying a `color` property directly to the `ul`. This changes the color of the dots without adding a new dot or extra content. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
N:how to put a border around an image and make it purple
Chat:A purple border has been added to all images, with an optional rounded corner effect using `border-radius`. If you want to apply the style to specific images only, let me know!
N:how would I adjust paragraphs inside of a footer 
Chat:Paragraphs inside the footer can now be adjusted using the new `#footer p` style. It includes customizable properties like margins, font size, color, and line height. Let me know if you need further refinements!
N:how to make the background of the footer larger to support large text
Chat:The footer's background has been adjusted with extra padding and a minimum height to support larger text. You can further tweak the `padding` or `min-height` as needed for your design. Let me know if you need additional changes!
N:how to make a table border black
Chat:The borders of the table have been updated to black. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to modify!
N:how would I move the quiz items to the right of the box
Chat:The quiz items in the `#quiz-section` are now aligned to the right of the box using the `text-align: right;` property. Let me know if you need further adjustments or other alignments!
N:but also keep an image on the left of the same block
Chat:I updated the `#quiz-section` to use a flexible layout with `display: flex`, allowing you to place an image on the left and text content on the right. You can customize the image size and spacing further using the `#quiz-section img` and `.content` classes. Let me know if more adjustments are needed!
N:and over the image keep a header
Chat:I've updated the `#quiz-section` to include a container for the image with a header placed over it. The `h3` inside the `.image-container` is centered on top of the image and styled for readability. Let me know if you need further changes!

This stylesheet includes basic styles for each of the specified IDs. You can adjust the colors, paddings, and other properties as needed to match your design requirements. Let me know if you’d like to further customize any part!
